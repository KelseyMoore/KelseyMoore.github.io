<h3>Screen #1: Login Page</h3>

    <pre>
    This screen is for the story of having a login/sign-up page for members.  
    Questions I had with this page included whether I should show the sign-up process, 
    design the page more (rather than just having the right content),
    and also if I should link the page to other pages to add a sense of functionality.
    </pre>

<h3>Screen #2: Add Events Page</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
  This screen is for the story of being able to add volunteer events.
  Questions I had with this page included figuring out how to make a text input box 
  look like an input box rather than just a text box (I changed the opacity),
  how to make the page look more real, and, again, if I should link multiple pages
  in one to create a sense of functionality.
