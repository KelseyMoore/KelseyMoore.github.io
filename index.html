	       The section in chapter 1 that spoke to me was <b>Software Entropy</b>,
	which talks about the <i>Broken Window Theory</i>.  This section relates a lot to my life and my work,
	as sometimes I overlook an error that causes a lot of damage in the future.
	I believe it is important to do your work <ins>to the best of your ability</ins>,
	making sure that everything is adequate as you go- not waiting until the end to fix mistakes.
	I have had experience in groups where the code we were writing was very messy.
	We brushed it off for later, but by the time we went back to fix it,
	the code wouldn't work with the correct code, because we had written the latter code of of the incorrect piece of code.
	This leads to a lot of frustration and confusion, resulting in stressed out group members and rushing to meet the deadline.

	        <b>"Boarding up"</b> a problem in your code is a quick-fix that you can use, and I can say that I use it regularly.
	Commenting out code that doesn't work makes the frustration of error messages disappear.
	I find this to be useful, but it is also a false-sense of security and correctness.
	The idea of <b>"boarding up"</b> broken windows seems like a good idea if it only for a short period of time,
	but if you leave pieces boarded up, eventually you will have to go back and fix them,
	which could cause problems with the rest of your work.
	Instead, this section said to fix your errors as you go to prevent overlooking them or writing incorrect code later on.

	       Overall, this section on software entropy really spoke to me because it pointed out the problems
	of brushing off mistakes and issues for later.  I do this a lot in my everyday life,
	whether it be procrastinating homework or ignoring a pressing issue in my personal life or social life.
	This section has opened my eyes to the dangers of "broken windows" and how to deal with them.
